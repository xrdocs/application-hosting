## Introduction

If you haven't checked out the earlier parts to the XR toolbox Series, then you can do so here:  

[XR Toolbox Series]({{ base_path }}/tags/#xr-toolbox)
{: .notice--info}
  
The purpose of this series is simple. Get users started with an IOS-XR setup on their laptop and incrementally enable them to try out the application-hosting infrastructure on IOS-XR.

In this part, we explore how a user can build and deploy their own container (LXC) based applications on IOS-XR.


## Pre-requisites

Before we begin, let's make sure you're set up with your development environment.
If you haven't checked it out, go through the "App-Development Topology" tutorial here:
